Service Provider, a web application through which customers
can request a service like electrical,plumbing, carpeting, painting,
repairing & maintenance, cleaning, and many more. This project is primarily
focused on providing service to customer’s doorstep.
This application is also provided with a feedback-based
rating facility for the customer so that the quality of
service can be improved. Customers are also able to
complain to the shopkeeper about any service. The
Admin has full control over the system and approves the
registered shopkeeper. This web application is
developed using some advanced technologies which are
in great demand in the IT industry today

\section{Introduction}
In today’s life, everyone is engaged with busy schedules and
hectic tasks which make them deviate from family life. If any
problem encounters unexpectedly, it distracts them and
makes them choose over the work they have to accomplish
primarily. It is significant to manage both professional and
family life. In such circumstances, every one of us would
have imagined a kind of house that doesn’t have any fault in
electrical devices, leaks in pipes, and a kind of house which
never face any maintenance issues and every one of us has
thought that life would be much better if no problem arises in
getting service at your doorstep. In such a situation, online
service providers play a vital role in today’s life as it has so
many advantages in our life because it makes our daily life
easy. So, giving an idea to design and develop a system that
provides many different services at your doorstep in just one
click. A System that provides different categories of services
like electrical, plumbing, carpeting, painting, repairing &
maintenance, cleaning, and many more. To make it
comfortable for all the users our system is user-friendly. The
System is flexible as a service can be booked from
anywhere you desire.

\section{Design}
The project is developed using a specific software
development lifecycle. I have created a modular design
showing all the functionalities of all end users. Then I have
created UML Models consisting of Use case diagram, Class
diagram, Sequence diagram, and Activity diagram. After
that, I designed the UI using Adobe XD.

\subsection{Technology}
Multiple technologies are used in our system.HTML, CSS,
JavaScript is used for front-end styling of applications. These
languages are used to develop Front End UI. REACT.JS is
used for the front-End UI interface / UI component and to
fetch backend data through API in our application. We used
NODE.JS as a backend runtime environment and
Express.js is used as a backend web application framework
for node.js. Database MongoDB is used to store all the data
of our system.

\subsection{Tools}
AdobeXD is used to create UI. VS code tool is used for
backend and front end programming and to store data in
MongoDB database MongoDB atlas tool is used.

\section{Implementation}
\subsection{sign up/ Log in}
for new users signup page will be open
and if a user is already registered in the application then log
-in page will be opened.

\section{Results and Discussions}
A functional web application in which customers have to log
in first. Then they can request a particular service. This
request goes to the shopkeeper and technician dashboard.
Shopkeepers can manage the details of technicians.
Customers can also give feedback and complaints about any
service. Shopkeepers can view feedback and complaints
from the customer so that they can improve their services.
To verify, the technician is doing his job or not, there is an
OTP system in which the customer will receive the OTP and
it will be shared with the technician only when he goes to do
his job

\section{Conclusion}
A service provider web application is developed which helps
in online service booking. Service Provider application is the
new trend in the market of on-demand applications. Although
services like UrbanClap, Handyman, and Taskrabbit are
already existing in the market; there are still many
possibilities that we can explore and execute. With proper
market research, the inclusion of vital features, user’s needs,
followed by appropriate marketing can make your app
successful.

\section{future work}
In the future, we can develop a web application in which we
will put map navigation for the technician to find the location
of the customer and also for the customer to track the
technician using GPS. We can also add payment methods to
our system so that the customers can pay online.
